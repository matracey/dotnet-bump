dotnet-bump <target> [options] [file..]

Bump to target version, one of:

- major, minor, patch;
- a specific version like 2.4.0 (must be semver).

Files can be glob patterns or paths to a:

- Visual Studio Solution (*.sln) (parsed to find projects)
- Project (*.csproj or *.fsproj) (parsed to find AssemblyInfo)
- C# or F# source code file;
- Directory containing any of the above.

Default is the current working directory. Files must reside
in a git working tree (or multiple working trees).

Options:

--dry-run  -d  Print changes but don't make them
--force    -f  Continue if git working tree(s) are dirty
--no-commit    Don't commit and tag
--no-glob      Disable globbing
--verbose      Verbose output
--version  -v  Print version and exit
--help     -h  Print usage and exit
